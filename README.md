In order to run this code, all files in the materials folder must be moved back a directory. This should fix all library and module import issues.
I just put them all in to follow the submission guidelines. There are three core files that you should use to run the code and see results.

Due to the immense size of all of the files, I could not upload any model checkpoints.
