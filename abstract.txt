Generating 3D models from a single image has been a long time complex task that is more recently
making advancements. This paper explores one such method to this problem. Using a combination of
a Feature extractor and a Graph convolutional Netowrk, an initial mesh is progressively
deformed until it resembles the goal mesh (an object in picture). For thsi implementation, I
perform training solely on airplanes. It furthermore attempts to develope a more modern
netowrk that implements efficient and easy use of modern python libraries and gpu acceleration. 
My resutls suggest that there are many complexeties to such a task, making the 3D generation
a complex and difficult-to-replicate task. Though my model and all of the underlying code
is built effieciently and effectively. For further improvements, a better analyusis pipeline should
be implemented with analysis of how loss weights for each block effect the results as a whole.
